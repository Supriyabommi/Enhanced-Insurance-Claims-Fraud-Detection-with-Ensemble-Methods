# Enhanced-Insurance-Claims-Fraud-Detection-with-Ensemble-Methods
•	Conducted in-depth exploratory data analysis, handled missing values through KNN imputation, addressed class imbalance by Implementing SMOTE and Recursive Feature Elimination to enhance model performance.
•	Applied Voting and Stacking classifiers to integrate predictions from Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) Learning models. Optimized model performance through hyperparameter tuning.
•	Evaluated model performance using metrics like ROC AUC, precision, and recall. Achieved the highest accuracy of 82.5% and a ROC AUC score of 0.846 with the XGBoost model.
